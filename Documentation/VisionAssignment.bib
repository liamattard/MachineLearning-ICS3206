abstract = {In the event that you have ever utilized web based life, a computerized camera, or a mobile phone, odds are you have experienced face detection more than once. Well known online networking applications extending from Facebook to Snapchat use face detection for a few of their prevalent highlights, for example, labeling companions and applying channels. Face detection is characterized as PC innovation that is utilized to recognize human faces in computerized pictures. There are different PC algorithms that are utilized in the field of face detection, however this paper will concentrate on two of the most well known strategies: Convolutional Neural Networks and the Viola-Jones calculation. The inspiration for this paper is a general interest about face detection in regular daily existence just as an oddity about how face detection algorithms work, in my classes so far I have discussed the structure of various kinds of PC frameworks however I have never dug into algorithms for these frameworks. This task offered the chance to find out about face detection as well as dive into the universe of PC algorithms.},

@article{Zou2019,
abstract = {Object detection, as of one the most fundamental and challenging problems in computer vision, has received great attention in recent years. Its development in the past two decades can be regarded as an epitome of computer vision history. If we think of today's object detection as a technical aesthetics under the power of deep learning, then turning back the clock 20 years we would witness the wisdom of cold weapon era. This paper extensively reviews 400+ papers of object detection in the light of its technical evolution, spanning over a quarter-century's time (from the 1990s to 2019). A number of topics have been covered in this paper, including the milestone detectors in history, detection datasets, metrics, fundamental building blocks of the detection system, speed up techniques, and the recent state of the art detection methods. This paper also reviews some important detection applications, such as pedestrian detection, face detection, text detection, etc, and makes an in-deep analysis of their challenges as well as technical improvements in recent years.},
